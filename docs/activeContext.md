# Active Context: AI-Powered E2E Test Framework

**Last Updated**: September 10, 2025

## 1. Current Status

The project has completed a major architectural refactoring and now has strong unit test coverage for its core logic. The workflow is managed by `LangGraph` and AI interactions are unified through `LangChainAIService`.

The `generate` command has been removed to streamline the project's focus on executing tests from pre-written markdown files. The documentation has been refactored into a Memory Bank structure for clarity and AI-friendliness.

**Version**: 0.2.0-alpha
**Next Milestone**: Enhance Core Features (Phase 2 of Roadmap)

## 2. Recent Accomplishments (September 2025)

- **Comprehensive Unit Testing**: Added extensive unit tests for all core components (`TestExecutorAgent`, `AnalysisAgent`, `LangGraphWorkflow`, `LangChainAIService`), significantly increasing code quality and stability. This process also uncovered and fixed critical bugs in the workflow logic and AI service.
- **Architectural Refactor**: Migrated from a simple sequential runner to a `LangGraph` workflow.
- **Unified AI Service**: Centralized all LLM interactions into `LangChainAIService`, fixing critical hanging bugs.
- **Intelligent Wait Handling**: Enhanced the core AI prompt to intelligently generate wait commands, fixing the root cause of navigation failures.
- **Feature Streamlining**: Removed the AI-powered test generation feature (`generate` command) to focus the tool's scope.
- **Documentation Overhaul**: Restructured all project documentation into a clear, Memory Bank format.

## 3. Outstanding Items & Next Steps

### 3.1 Immediate Priorities

With testing infrastructure now robust, the next priority is to begin **Phase 2** of the roadmap, starting with **Core Features Enhancement**. The first task will be implementing smart element selection strategies.

### 3.2 Project Roadmap

#### Phase 2: Core Features Enhancement

- **Improved Test Execution**:
  - [ ] Implement smart element selection strategies.
  - [ ] Add support for environment-specific configurations.
- **Enhanced Reporting**:
  - [ ] Develop detailed HTML reports with screenshots.
  - [ ] Integrate accessibility insights more deeply.
  - [ ] Add performance metrics collection.
- **Reliability Improvements**:
  - [ ] Implement advanced retry mechanisms.
  - [ ] Develop flaky test detection.

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- **Parallel Execution**: Implement multi-scenario parallel execution.
- **Advanced AI Features**: Explore test maintenance suggestions and automatic test healing.
- **Integration Ecosystem**: Add support for GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Docker.

## 4. Key Architectural Decisions on Record

- **Workflow Engine**: `LangGraph` is the central orchestrator.
- **AI Interaction**: All LLM calls must go through the unified `LangChainAIService`.
- **Test Execution**: The `TestExecutorAgent` uses a "Pure AI-First" approach, where the AI generates browser commands for each step based on a real-time page snapshot.
- **Test Definition**: Tests are defined exclusively in markdown (`.md`) files, supported by `config.yml` for configuration and variables.
