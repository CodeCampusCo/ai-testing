# Active Context: AI-Powered E2E Test Framework

**Last Updated**: September 10, 2025 (End of Session)

## 1. Current Status

The project has undergone a series of significant refactorings and bug fixes, resulting in a more robust, efficient, and maintainable codebase. The AI interaction layer has been modernized using LangChain's structured output capabilities, and the entire test suite is passing. The project is stable and core functionality is working as expected.

**Version**: 0.3.0-alpha (est.)
**Next Milestone**: Continue with Phase 2 of the Roadmap.

## 2. Recent Accomplishments (September 10, 2025 Session)

- **Major AI Service Refactor**:
  - Replaced manual JSON parsing with LangChain's `.withStructuredOutput()` for all AI calls, drastically improving reliability and fixing numerous parsing bugs.
  - Decoupled logic by creating `PromptFactory` and `ModelFactory`, making the `LangChainAIService` a cleaner service layer.
- **AI-Powered Scenario Parsing**:
  - Implemented a new `ParsingAgent` that uses AI to parse `.md` test files, making the process more flexible than the previous string-based method.
- **Enhanced Reporting & UX**:
  - Improved the `StepProgressManager` to display step counts correctly in the live output.
  - Added a dedicated "Outcome Verification" section to the final test report to clearly distinguish between step failures and outcome failures.
- **Token Usage Tracking**:
  - Implemented a feature to track and display total, input, and output token usage for each test run, providing valuable cost analysis data.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**:
  - Fixed the entire test suite after the major refactoring.
  - Added new unit tests for the `ParsingAgent`, `PromptFactory`, and `ModelFactory`, ensuring high test coverage for the new architecture.

## 3. Outstanding Items & Next Steps

### 3.1 Immediate Priorities

With the core architecture now stable and well-tested, the next priority is to continue with **Phase 2** of the roadmap. The first task remains **"Add support for environment-specific configurations"**.

### 3.2 Project Roadmap

#### Phase 2: Core Features Enhancement

- **Improved Test Execution**:
  - [ ] Add support for environment-specific configurations.
- **Enhanced Reporting**:
  - [ ] Develop detailed HTML reports with screenshots.
  - [ ] Integrate accessibility insights more deeply.
  - [ ] Add performance metrics collection.
- **Reliability Improvements**:
  - [ ] Implement advanced retry mechanisms.
  - [ ] Develop flaky test detection.

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- **Parallel Execution**: Implement multi-scenario parallel execution.
- **Integration Ecosystem**: Add support for GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Docker.

## 4. Key Architectural Decisions on Record

- **Workflow Engine**: `LangGraph` is the central orchestrator.
- **AI Interaction**: All AI calls use specific methods in `LangChainAIService` that leverage `.withStructuredOutput()` for robust, typed responses.
- **Decoupled Factories**: Prompt and Model creation logic is fully decoupled into `PromptFactory` and `ModelFactory`.
- **Test Definition**: Tests are defined in markdown (`.md`) and parsed by the AI-powered `ParsingAgent`.
