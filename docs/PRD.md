# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Powered E2E Test Framework

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the requirements for an E2E test framework developed on Node.js. It leverages AI to assist in both test creation and analysis. The purpose of this tool is to be a versatile solution that can be used for any website, supporting both automated workflows in CI/CD and interactive use for developers.

## 2. Target Audience

**Developers and QA Engineers** who need to quickly create E2E tests without writing extensive code.

**DevOps Engineers** who need to run E2E tests as part of their CI/CD pipeline.

## 3. Business Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Goals

- Improve test reliability through accessibility-based automation
- Provide comprehensive test insights beyond pass/fail results

### 3.2 Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: 70% of development teams using the framework within 6 months
- **Test Coverage**: 25% increase in E2E test coverage across projects
- **Maintenance Effort**: 50% reduction in test maintenance overhead

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1 Automated Test Execution (my-cli-run)

- **Headless by Default**: Optimized for CI/CD with optional headed mode for development
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit compatibility
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple scenarios simultaneously (future feature)
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Automatic handling of flaky test conditions

### 4.2 AI-Powered Analysis

- **Intelligent Reporting**: Detailed insights even when tests pass
- **Performance Insights**: Page load times, interaction delays, resource usage
- **Accessibility Assessment**: WCAG compliance checks and recommendations
- **Failure Analysis**: Root cause analysis with suggested fixes

## 5. User Stories

### 5.1 DevOps Engineer

"As a DevOps engineer, I want reliable E2E tests that run fast in CI/CD pipelines and provide actionable feedback, so that I can catch issues before they reach production."

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Performance

- Test execution speed: 2x faster than traditional screenshot-based tools
- Resource usage: Minimal CPU and memory footprint

### 6.2 Reliability

- 99% test execution success rate for stable applications
- Automatic retry mechanisms for temporary failures
- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

### 6.3 Usability

- Zero-configuration setup for basic use cases
- Intuitive CLI interface with helpful prompts
- Clear error messages with suggested solutions

### 6.4 Security

- Secure handling of authentication credentials
- No storage of sensitive data in plain text
- Support for various authentication methods (tokens, cookies, OAuth)

## 7. Constraints and Assumptions

### 7.1 Technical Constraints

- Requires Node.js v18+ runtime environment
- Depends on MCP-compatible client for Playwright integration
- Needs active internet connection for AI provider APIs

### 7.2 Business Constraints

- AI provider costs scale with usage
- Limited by AI model capabilities and rate limits
- Requires user training for optimal effectiveness

### 7.3 Assumptions

- Users have basic understanding of web applications
- Target websites are publicly accessible or properly configured for testing
- Development teams are willing to adopt new testing approaches

## 8. Out of Scope

### 8.1 Current Release

- Visual regression testing capabilities
- Direct integration with test management tools (Jira, TestRail)
- Mobile application testing support
- Load testing and performance benchmarking

### 8.2 Report Distribution

The framework will not include functionality to directly upload reports to hosting services (e.g., GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting). This will be handled as a separate deployment step within the CI/CD pipeline.

## 9. Future Considerations

### 9.1 Short-term (3-6 months)

- Support for running multiple scenarios in parallel
- Integration with popular CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Basic visual regression testing using accessibility snapshots

### 9.2 Long-term (6-12 months)

- Integration with other tools such as Jira or Slack
- Development of a UI for scenario creation as an alternative to the CLI
- Advanced AI capabilities like predictive testing and auto-healing tests
- Mobile testing support through Appium integration

## 10. Acceptance Criteria

### 10.1 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- ✅ CLI tool with a `run` command
- ✅ Natural language to test command conversion
- ✅ Playwright MCP integration for browser automation
- ✅ Basic reporting with pass/fail status
- ✅ Configuration management through YAML files

### 10.2 Version 1.0

- Enhanced AI analysis with accessibility insights
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Performance metrics and optimization recommendations
- Integration with popular development workflows
- Documentation and community resources
