# AI E2E Test Framework - Session Context

## Current Status: Phase 2 Complete - Production Ready! 🚀
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-04  
**Phase**: Ready for Production Use

## Project Overview
AI-Powered End-to-End Testing Framework using Playwright MCP and LangGraph.js for natural language test creation and execution.

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright MCP Server (`npx @playwright/mcp@latest`)
- **AI Orchestration**: LangGraph.js with 3 specialized agents
- **Test Format**: Natural language Markdown + YAML configuration
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js 18+, TypeScript, MCP integration

## Next Steps (Implementation Phase 1)
1. **MCP Client**: Implement Playwright MCP integration ✅
2. **AI Agents**: Build scenario generation, execution, and analysis agents  
3. **CLI Commands**: Create `my-cli-generate` and `my-cli-run`
4. **File Parsing**: Markdown test parser and YAML config reader

## Completed Features ✅
**Phase 1: MCP Client**
1. ✅ **Dynamic MCP Client**: Runtime tool discovery with Playwright integration
2. ✅ **Browser Automation**: Real-time accessibility snapshots and element interaction
3. ✅ **Comprehensive Tests**: 14/14 unit tests with proper mocking

**Phase 2: AI Agent Architecture**  
1. ✅ **Scenario Generator Agent**: Natural language → structured test scenarios
2. ✅ **Test Executor Agent**: Browser automation via MCP integration
3. ✅ **Analysis Agent**: AI-powered result analysis and recommendations
4. ✅ **Multi-Provider AI**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI support
5. ✅ **Production CLI**: Complete command-line interface
6. ✅ **Workflow Engine**: Sequential agent processing with streaming

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
1. **Advanced Test Formats**: Markdown + YAML configuration files
2. **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins plugins
3. **Advanced Reporting**: HTML reports, test result dashboards
4. **Multi-Browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari testing
5. **Team Collaboration**: Shared test scenarios and results
