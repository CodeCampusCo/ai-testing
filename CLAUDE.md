# AI E2E Test Framework - Session Context

## Current Status: Phase 1 MCP Client Complete ✅
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-04  
**Phase**: Phase 2 - AI Agents & CLI Development

## Project Overview
AI-Powered End-to-End Testing Framework using Playwright MCP and LangGraph.js for natural language test creation and execution.

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright MCP Server (`npx @playwright/mcp@latest`)
- **AI Orchestration**: LangGraph.js with 3 specialized agents
- **Test Format**: Natural language Markdown + YAML configuration
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js 18+, TypeScript, MCP integration

## Next Steps (Implementation Phase 1)
1. **MCP Client**: Implement Playwright MCP integration ✅
2. **AI Agents**: Build scenario generation, execution, and analysis agents  
3. **CLI Commands**: Create `my-cli-generate` and `my-cli-run`
4. **File Parsing**: Markdown test parser and YAML config reader

## Next Steps (Implementation Phase 2)
1. **AI Agent Architecture**: Design LangGraph.js workflow with 3 agents
2. **Scenario Generator Agent**: Convert natural language to test steps
3. **Test Executor Agent**: Run browser automation with MCP client
4. **Analysis Agent**: Evaluate results and generate reports
5. **CLI Interface**: Build command-line tools for test management
6. **Test File Parser**: Support Markdown tests + YAML config

## Progress Tracking:
**🔔 REMINDER**: Update this file when completing above tasks!
- Use template in `.claude-update-template.md`
- Mark completed tasks with ✅ 
- Add "Today's Progress" section when significant work is done

## Context for AI Assistant
- Documentation phase is COMPLETE
- **MCP Client phase is COMPLETE** (Dynamic Playwright MCP integration)
- Ready for Phase 2: AI Agents and CLI development
- Focus on LangGraph.js workflow and natural language test processing

## Important Notes
- **MCP Implementation**: Dynamic tool discovery with `callTool()` approach ✅
- **Architecture**: PlaywrightMCPClient + MCPClient with full test coverage
- **Next Priority**: LangGraph.js agents for natural language processing
- Support multiple AI providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
- File-based test management with accessibility-focused automation
- Target: Natural language → executable browser tests

## Today's Progress (2025-01-04)
- ✅ **Dynamic MCP Client**: Refactored to runtime tool discovery
- ✅ **Comprehensive Tests**: 14/14 tests passing with proper mocks
- ✅ **Real Browser Testing**: Verified with Google.com automation
- ✅ **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused types and temporary files
- ✅ **Git Workflow**: Committed and updated PR #5
