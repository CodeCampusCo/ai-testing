# AI E2E Test Framework - Session Context

## Current Status: Documentation Complete ✅
**Last Updated**: 2024-01-03  
**Phase**: Ready for Implementation (Phase 1 MVP)

## Project Overview
AI-Powered End-to-End Testing Framework using Playwright MCP and LangGraph.js for natural language test creation and execution.

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright MCP Server (`npx @playwright/mcp@latest`)
- **AI Orchestration**: LangGraph.js with 3 specialized agents
- **Test Format**: Natural language Markdown + YAML configuration
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js 18+, TypeScript, MCP integration

## Next Steps (Implementation Phase 1)
1. **MCP Client**: Implement Playwright MCP integration
2. **AI Agents**: Build scenario generation, execution, and analysis agents  
3. **CLI Commands**: Create `my-cli-generate` and `my-cli-run`
4. **File Parsing**: Markdown test parser and YAML config reader

## Progress Tracking:
**🔔 REMINDER**: Update this file when completing above tasks!
- Use template in `.claude-update-template.md`
- Mark completed tasks with ✅ 
- Add "Today's Progress" section when significant work is done

## Context for AI Assistant
- Documentation phase is COMPLETE
- All specifications and examples are ready
- Ready to begin actual code implementation
- Focus on building functional MVP

## Important Notes
- MCP config: `{"mcpServers": {"playwright": {"command": "npx", "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]}}}`
- Support multiple AI providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
- File-based test management with accessibility-focused automation
- Target: Natural language → executable browser tests
